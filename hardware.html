<p class="gray-text">The motherboard is the main printed circuit board. It allows communication between <br> the components and parts of the system. It is referred to as the "Mother" because it is <br> attached and connected to so many of the parts and is necessary for the computer<br> to function properly. Some parts the motherboard can connect to are peripherals,<br> interphace cards, daughter cards: sound cards, video cards, network cards, hard drives<br> and many more.</p>

<p class="gray-text">The hard drive is a data storage device for storing and retrieving digital information. The <br> primary characteristics of the hard drive are its capacity measured in terabytes(TB, <br> 1 TB = 1,000 gigabytes) and its performance. </p>

<font size="5" class="darksalmon slant-text"> How are these parts connected?</font>
<p class="gray-text">all internal components are linked with the motherboard and the motherboard allows the <br> components to communicate with each other.

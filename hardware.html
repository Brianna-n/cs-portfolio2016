<p class="gray-text">The motherboard is the main printed circuit board. It allows communication between <br> the components and parts of the system. It is referred to as the "Mother" because it is <br> attached and connected to so many of the parts and is necessary for the computer<br> to function properly. Some parts the motherboard can connect to are peripherals,<br> interphace cards, daughter cards: sound cards, video cards, network cards, hard drives<br> and many more. The motherboard is typically made of plastic with thin layers of metal, usually <br> copper or aluminium, printed onto the board.</p>

 <p class="gray-text">The CPU(centeral processing unit) is the circuitry within the computer that carries out<br> the instructions of a program. There are many components of the CPU, such as the<br> Arithmetic Logic Unit(ALU, a unit in the computer that carries out logic and arithmetic units), processor registers(that hold the data to be processed), and the control unit(which directs the operations of the processor). Most modern <br> CPUs are microprocessors and are contained on an IC chip. The CPU recieves the information <br> from the keyboard and mouse and carries out the commands on the computer.  </p>

<p class="gray-text"> The RAM(random access memory) is a form of computer storage that allows data items<br> to be read in nearly the same time regardless of their physical locations. RAM is much faster <br> to read from and write to in comparison to other kinds of storage. It is called <br> random access memory because it can access any storage location directly. RAM comes in <br> small microchips and can be plugged into the motherboard. </p>

<p class="gray-text">The hard drive is a data storage device for storing and retrieving digital information. The <br> primary characteristics of the hard drive are its capacity measured in terabytes(TB, <br> 1 TB = 1,000 gigabytes) and its performance. The hard drive has a small disk, called a platter, <br> which spins at 15,000 rpm for high performing servers and the platters are held down by a spindle.<br> The platters are made of non-magnetic material, coated in a thin layer of magnetic material <br> and protected by a layer of carbon for protection. </p>

<div class="modify"><font size="5" class="darksalmon slant-text"> How are these parts connected?</font>
<p class="gray-text">all internal components are linked with the motherboard and the motherboard allows the <br> components to communicate with each other. However the following components are not powered <br> by the motherboard, but they are powered by the motherboard when their cords are plugged into ports <br> outside of the computer

<font size="5" class="darksalmon slant-text"> <br> <font size="5"></font> Keyboard</font>
<p class="gray-text"> a set of lettered keys in a typewriter style that are connected to the computer, you can type<br> out words or give commands to the computer by pressing keys or holding several keys. The most common type of keyboard is the QWERTY keyboard. QWERTY are the first 6 letter symbols on this keyboard. The letter symbols are laid out flat in front of the user in a rectangular shape, however other types of keyboards have been developed like handheld keyboards, thumbsized keyboards, and multifunctional keyboards which are programable, can control different computers and can have customized keypads.

<font size="5" class="darksalmon slant-text"> Mouse</font>
<p class="gray-text"> a device that lets the user of point and select objects on the screen when it is moved. It <br> typically is in an oval shape with two buttons, one on either side, and a wheel in between the<br> buttons that can act as a scrolling device. However, mice also come in flat pads like in laptops

<p class="gray-text"> The monitor is the screen for the computer where all images, websites, etc are displayed. <br>In more modern computers, the monitor is displayed with a thin film transistor liquid crystal <br>display(TFT-LCD) or a flat panel LED display.

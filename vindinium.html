     <p class="darksalmon slant-text"> The Game
     </p>

     <p class="gray-text"> Vindinium is a multi-player game in which 
     the goal of the game is to have to most gold at the end of the game.
     The game consists of 1200 turns. The way to obtain gold in through 
     mines. The mines are guarded by goblins which the player has to attack
     the goblin in order to claim the mind, thus, losing health. However 
     a mine is claimed, the player gets one gold each turn from each of the 
     mines they have claimed. 
    
    <br>
    
Another way to earn gold is if one kills an opposing player. If the opposing
player dies, they will respawn but all their mines will belong to the killer. 
But a player can heal before they die at a tavern. However, the tavern costs 2 
gold to use. The only way the bots can be controlled is through coding their 
commands.

This section of code tells the bot that if the task is "freeMines", it should search for the nearest mine by putting<br> all available mains in an array and going through each of the mines and finding which one is closest to the position<br> of the bot. This action is named "Claiming a Free Mine!" and the bot's direction is set toward the freeMine.

 This section tells the bot that if the task is taverns, to find the nearest tavern and go to it. All taverns on the map<br> are put into an array and all of them are surveyed to find which is closes to the bot's position. The action is named<br> "Healing" and the direction of the bot is set to the closest tavern.

  This code tells the bot when the task is "enemyMines", they have to find the closest mine that isn't already<br> in their possession and take it. All the enemy mines are put into an array and all of them are read to see which<br> one is closest to the bot's position. Then the bot's direction is set towards that enemy mine. This action is activated <br>either randomly or when no more free mines are available.

 Thise code sets the direction to random if the bot's direction isn't set by a task. It goes randomly north, south,<br> east, west until another task is assigned to it.

     <p class="gray-text"> 
     My bot mostly does the tasks I've programmed it to do but it is difficult to control it all the time because sometimes it does not listen to the commands but other times it does. It was quite a complicated process trying to program it. I had no idea that other AI's were created by coding and I wonder how they work so well compared to mind which only works half the time.

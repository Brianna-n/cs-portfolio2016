</tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="gray-text"> The creator's name is Brianna Marie Nusbaum, but just prefers going by Brianna. She is a sophomore who goes to a public school called Summit Shasta, located in Daly City by Serramonte. Brianna had the littlest experience in coding, yet she took the expeditions class called "Intro to Computer Science" although it was quite far from her first choice. She was somewhat nervous of the class because of her inexperience with coding and the fact that she was taking two UC approved courses so she would get double the work, but decided to stay to see how it played out for her. </td>

  <td class="slant-text darksalmon">Lolita, Kawaii, etc Fashion:</td>
  </tr>
  <td class="gray-text">Lolita/Kawaii/etc Fashion originated in Japan that somewhat resembles Victorian however is very different. It is characterized by modest clothing, knee-length fluffy skirts, light colors, lace, bowls, and ruffles. Much like what a doll would wear. Brianna was interested in this because she likes cute, light things and these fluffy, princess-esque dresses really caught her attention. There are many subcategories of Lolita and Japanese fashion that not even she knows or can keep track of but she still enjoys the aesthetic of such clothing anyway.

<td class="slant-text darksalmon">Crafting:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td class="gray-text">Brianna does enjoy art but she is mainly only experienced in drawing traditionally and digitally. She enjoys crafting, sewing, and other more tangible forms of art because she does want to broaden her skills in other forms of art. Usually she needs many instructions for this and is often nervous to start new projects in fear of messing them up due to her inexperience with other kinds of art. However, she still enjoys crafting despite it not always turning out in her favor.

 <th class="darksalmon">MAIN HOBBY: DRAWING</th>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="gray-text"> She has been drawing ever since three years old and has enjoyed it since it is quite calming and therapeutic. Although she is not very experienced in drawing realism, she is quite talented in manga-style art, art-style mimicry, and has even developed her own art style. She very much enjoys drawing people and anatomy the most. Brianna however has never been commissioned. Brianna also does digital drawing and prefers to color digitally rather than traditionally.
